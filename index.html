										EXCESS LOAN CHARGES FORENSIC EXAMINATION AND INVESTMENT DECISION</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Loan charges.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project is in two parts, the first part is excess loan charges forensic examination, the second part is on investment decision. Moulin Pooch Co. had oustanding loan of $450,000 to be repaid over six years. The task here is to calcualte the monthly loan repayments, determine the balance at the end of the 3rd year and establish if the bank's monthly charges are accurate or not. Also, the company had two potential investment opportunities. The task here is to calculate as a financial analyst, the NPV of the two options and Provide a recommendation for which scenario is better for Moulin Pooch Co. Our recommendation was for the company to invest in option 1.This is simply because, after six years of investment, the $200,000 investment will be recouped back in the 5th year and the NPV as at the end of the 6th year will be $143,346 as against the investment of $300,00									
										that will be totally recouped in the 6th year and with a  sum of $37,471 as NPV of the store, even though the capital invested was higher.
